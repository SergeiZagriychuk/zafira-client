# Zafira Java Client
Official client library for Zafira wrapping its REST API

## IDE settings
Zafira Client is build with Gradle meaning that source code should be imported accordingly. 
Additional IDE setup might be required since Zafira Client uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) to avoid boilerplate code for POJOs - annotation processing should be enabled (if it's not, IDE will complain about a bunch of compile-time errors).
Please see this article for proper IDE setup: [Intellij](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij) | [Eclipse](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse)
